# Task: Create File Discovery Script

## Description
Create a shell script that scans the project root directory and identifies all markdown files (.md extension) excluding README.md. The script should output the list of files found for processing.

## Technical Requirements
- Use standard shell commands (find/grep/ls) for cross-platform compatibility
- Exclude README.md from the file list
- Handle edge cases (no markdown files found, empty directory)
- Output should be suitable for piping to next processing steps

## Implementation Steps
1. Create a shell script file (e.g., update-readme.sh)
2. Implement directory scanning logic
3. Add file filtering to exclude README.md
4. Add error handling for edge cases
5. Test with various directory structures

## Acceptance Criteria
- Script correctly identifies all .md files in root directory
- README.md is excluded from results
- Script handles empty directories gracefully
- Output format is consistent and parseable
