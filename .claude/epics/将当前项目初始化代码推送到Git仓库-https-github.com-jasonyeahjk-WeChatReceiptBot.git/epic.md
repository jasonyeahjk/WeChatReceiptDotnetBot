# Epic: 将当前项目初始化代码推送到Git仓库 https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git

## Overview
This epic outlines the technical approach for initializing the WeChatReceiptBot project as a Git repository and pushing it to the remote GitHub repository. The implementation will follow standard Git practices to establish version control while ensuring code integrity and security.

## Architecture Decisions
- Use standard Git initialization and push workflow
- Leverage existing .gitignore files if present, or create one based on .NET and Node.js project conventions
- Follow conventional commit practices for the initial commit
- Ensure secure authentication through SSH keys or personal access tokens
- Maintain existing project structure and file permissions

## Technical Approach
### Frontend Components
Not applicable for this task as it focuses on Git repository initialization rather than frontend development.

### Backend Services
Not applicable for this task as it focuses on Git repository initialization rather than backend service implementation.

### Infrastructure
- Local development environment with Git installed
- Network connectivity to GitHub
- Proper authentication configured (SSH key or personal access token)
- Sufficient disk space for repository operations

## Implementation Strategy
- Verify Git installation and configuration
- Check for existing .gitignore file and update if needed
- Initialize Git repository in project directory
- Add all relevant files and create initial commit
- Configure remote repository and push code
- Verify successful push and repository integrity

## Task Breakdown Preview
- [ ] Verify Git installation and authentication
- [ ] Initialize local Git repository
- [ ] Configure .gitignore and add files
- [ ] Create initial commit and push to remote repository
- [ ] Verify successful repository initialization

## Dependencies
- Git must be installed and accessible from command line
- Network connectivity to GitHub (github.com)
- Authentication credentials properly configured for GitHub access
- Read/write permissions for project directory

## Success Criteria (Technical)
- Local Git repository successfully initialized
- All project files added and committed with proper commit message
- Remote repository URL correctly configured
- Code successfully pushed to remote repository
- No sensitive files accidentally committed
- Repository is in a clean state with proper branch tracking

## Estimated Effort
- Overall timeline estimate: 1-2 hours
- Resource requirements: Developer with Git knowledge
- Critical path items: Git installation, authentication configuration, network connectivity
