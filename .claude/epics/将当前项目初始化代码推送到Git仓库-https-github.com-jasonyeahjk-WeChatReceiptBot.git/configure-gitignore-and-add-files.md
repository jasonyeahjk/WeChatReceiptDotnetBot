# Task: Configure .gitignore and add files

## Description
Create or update the .gitignore file to exclude sensitive and unnecessary files, then add all relevant project files to the Git repository.

## Requirements
- .gitignore file should exclude common sensitive files and directories for .NET and Node.js projects
- All relevant project files should be added to the repository
- No sensitive files (like configuration files with credentials) should be added

## Implementation Steps
1. Check if .gitignore already exists in the project
2. If it doesn't exist, create one with appropriate rules for .NET and Node.js projects
3. Review and update .gitignore to exclude:
   - bin/ and obj/ directories for .NET projects
   - node_modules/ directory for Node.js projects
   - .env files and other configuration files with sensitive data
   - IDE-specific files and directories
4. Add all files to the repository with `git add .`

## Acceptance Criteria
- .gitignore file exists and properly configured
- All relevant project files are staged for commit
- No sensitive files are staged
- Git status shows all files as ready to be committed
