2. Add remote repository with `git remote add origin https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git`
3. Push code to remote repository with `git push -u origin main`
4. Handle any potential issues with branch naming (main vs master)

## Acceptance Criteria
- Initial commit is successfully created with all project files
- Remote repository is correctly configured
- Code is successfully pushed to the remote repository
