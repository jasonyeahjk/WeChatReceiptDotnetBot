# PRD: 将当前项目初始化代码推送到Git仓库 https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git

## Executive Summary
This PRD outlines the requirements for initializing the current WeChatReceiptBot project codebase and pushing it to the specified Git repository at https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git. This is a foundational task that will establish version control for the project and enable collaborative development.

## Problem Statement
The WeChatReceiptBot project currently exists locally but has not been initialized with Git version control or pushed to a remote repository. To enable proper version control, collaboration, and backup, the project needs to be initialized as a Git repository and pushed to the specified GitHub repository.

## User Stories
### Primary User Personas
1. **Project Developer** - The main developer working on the WeChatReceiptBot project
2. **Team Members** - Other developers who may collaborate on the project
3. **Project Manager** - Person responsible for project oversight and version control

### User Journeys
1. As a developer, I want to initialize the project with Git so that I can track changes and maintain version history
2. As a team member, I want to push the code to a remote repository so that others can access and collaborate on the project
3. As a project manager, I want to ensure proper version control is established so that we can maintain code quality and enable rollback capabilities

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
1. Initialize the project directory as a Git repository
2. Add all project files to the repository
3. Create an initial commit with all files
4. Add the remote repository URL (https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git)
5. Push the code to the remote repository

### Non-Functional Requirements
1. Ensure all sensitive files are excluded from the repository via .gitignore
2. Maintain the existing project structure and file integrity
3. Preserve file permissions and execute any necessary pre-commit hooks
4. Ensure the push operation is secure and uses proper authentication

## Success Criteria
1. Project is successfully initialized as a Git repository
2. All non-ignored files are committed to the local repository
3. Code is successfully pushed to the remote repository at https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git
4. Remote repository contains all project files in the correct structure
5. Git history is properly established with an initial commit

## Constraints & Assumptions
1. The remote repository already exists at https://github.com/jasonyeahjk/WeChatReceiptBot.git
2. The user has proper authentication and permissions to push to the repository
3. Git is installed and properly configured on the system
4. The project directory contains all necessary files and code
5. Sufficient disk space and network connectivity are available

## Out of Scope
1. Creating the remote GitHub repository (assumed to already exist)
2. Configuring repository settings or permissions
3. Setting up CI/CD pipelines
4. Creating GitHub issues or project boards
5. Branch protection rules or other advanced Git features

## Dependencies
1. Git must be installed on the system
2. Network connectivity to GitHub
3. Authentication credentials for GitHub (SSH key or personal access token)
4. Proper file system permissions to read project files and write to the repository
